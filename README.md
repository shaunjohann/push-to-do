# push-to-do

1. Create a Notion integration: https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration

2. Download this repo to your PC.

3. Add the app to your device with Xcode.

4. Within settings, add:

- The internal integration token from the integration above
- The page ID if you want to add a to-do to a page
- The database ID if you want to add a page to a database

5. Enable "Add to database" if you prefer new pages instead of new to-dos.
